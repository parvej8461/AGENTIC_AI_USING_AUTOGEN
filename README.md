# Agentic AI Using AutoGen

This project demonstrates the implementation of Agentic Artificial Intelligence using Microsoft's AutoGen framework. AutoGen allows the creation of intelligent agents capable of autonomous decision making, collaboration, and structured task execution.

## Features

- Multi-agent collaboration
- Automated task breakdown and execution
- LLM-to-LLM communication
- Extendable architecture for custom tools and agents
- Jupyter Notebook example of real implementation

What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI systems are designed to:

Reason about objectives

Take initiative without explicit human prompting

Break tasks into manageable subtasks

Use external tools and communicate with other agents

AutoGen provides a modular system to design such coordinated agents.

Future Enhancements

Add advanced tools and memory capabilities

Integrate external APIs and knowledge sources

Convert into a deployable application
